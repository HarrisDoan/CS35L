1.) For comparing the HTML, in the git url:

example: github.com/eggert/tz/commit/_______
change this url to:
github.com/eggert/tz/compare/hash1..hash2

from the two commits I wanna compare for example 2022f and 2022g, you can find the commit ID in their respective commits. Paste them into that url with the /compare and then separate the ID's by two periods.

2.) When writing my script for comparison, couldn't figure out how to turn it into an executable: do this

1.) save the file somewhere as an ordinary text file
2.) open terminal and type in "chmod +x" and then paste the realpath to said .txt file
3.) Now its an executable


Lab B:

git log --pretty=format:'%h %an' --graph 2a7d63a2453e2c30353342a2c9385fa22a846987..c03bee6e9f5c05259f5f501e1f47cd8adb63af38
