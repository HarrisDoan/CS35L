1.) First I found the corresponding commit ID which was -> 0b55d930a69692c7f4e7b90e35fa41f6c46df4bc

To find this all you had to do was use the git log command:

git log v2.38.0..v2.39.0 --grep="merge-tree\|segfault"

We use v2.38.0 and v2.39.0 beacuse these are the two versions when the new code changes occurs. Then we look maybe for a comment of message on "merge tree" and "segfault."


2.) I eventually found a commit where a branch called merge-ort-in-read-only-repo was merged into maint-2.38. This was merged to fix a segementation fault in read-only respositories.

3.) I dug deeper and found the actual commit ID that corresponded to this exact fix: 0b55d930a69692c7f4e7b90e35fa41f6c46df4bc

4.) The title was: merge-ort: fix segmentation fault in read-only repositories

5.) Then looking at the changes it seems the changing of static void to static int and making sure their is a default int return pathway lead to this fix.
